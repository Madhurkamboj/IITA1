              Hello,
  My name is Madhur Kamboj (Manu), I was born in Punjab, India and I did all my Schooling there. I came to Australia in 2013 as an international student and finished Diplomas in Engineering and a Diploma in Hospitality management. After finishing my studies, I worked as a Chef for 5 years and then I decided to stay permanently in Australia. I worked hard to fulfill the requirements for Australian permanent residency and Citizenship and then finally I got my Citizenship in 2021. I love spending time with my two Pet birds which I love them as my family members. Although I do not follow any sports but, I do try to stay active by attending 4-5 gym session every week with my friends. Occasionally we also go for Badminton session.

            <p>
              My interest in IT started when my dad bought his first Mobile Phone back in 1998, I was only 5 years old and the idea of being able to talk to someone on the move was fascinating It was pretty much a size of brick and quite heavy. I remember that was the only mobile phone in our town, and people use to come to our house just to see my dad talking on the phone. Then
              few years later our town got Internet and my school got a new “Computer lab” then I compelled my dad buy me a computer. Our first computer was with 10gb hard drive, 128 mb ram and with intel Pentium processor, it was running windows 98. I was on that thing day and night just playing video games like Mario, Dave, snakes etc. Then my interest grew and I bought a another computer and I mostly played Call of duty on it and I also learned Adobe Photoshop and bunch of other programs on it, ever since then I am interested in a career in Information Technology.

            <h2>Choosing RMIT</h2>
            <p>
After losing my job as a Chef due to COVID, I started looking for different jobs. The choice of starting all over again and study was very difficult and studying a university degree was out of picture.
 So, I decided to start an apprenticeship as an Electrician I did that for couple of months, but it was just mostly hard work and it did not excite me, I was learning new things every day but that was not enough for me to keep going, then I finally decided to quit my job and save some money by working as Truck Driver for few months and start studying. I was looking for a place where I can be flexible with my studies and work, and I stumbled across Open Universities Australia, and they provided me with great opportunity to study any-time via RMIT online.

            <h2>Experience in IT</h2>
            <p>
            My experience in Information Technology is very basic. I can code basic website and know my way around my computer. I can also put together a desktop computer and I am my family’s go to computer guy if the run in-to problems like setting up their phones, which devices to buy,
             installing basic software or apps, editing photos and video. Most of my time which I spend on my computer is either studying or playing Call of duty.

          <h2>  My Expectations from this course</h2> <br>
My expectations and hopes are very high from RMIT, this course and Teachers. I am expecting that after completing my studies with RMIT I will have enough knowledge to pursue my Ideal Job. Obviously, I will have to do most of the work by staying motivated and consistent with my studies, but I hope that I will get enough help and support from my teachers and classmates.
