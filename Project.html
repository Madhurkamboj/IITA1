<h2>Overview</h2><br>
I want to build a Fitness Web application which will help to inspire, motivate and commit the end users to their fitness goals.
My goal is to develop a website or a web application which later can be deployed as an Android and IOS app. This website will be
 like a social media website where people can meet and achieve their fitness goals and the app version will have UI like dating
  app where you can find people near you to train with. The sole purpose of this project will be to help people to achieve their
   fitness goal together.
   <br>
<h2>Motivation</h2><br>
In 2020–21, 2 in 3 (67%) Australians aged 18 and over were overweight or obese (36% were overweight but not obese,
and 31% were obese). That’s around 12.5 million adults and I am one of them. I have been trying to maintain healthy
lifestyle and diet from almost a decade. With over 67% Australian adults being overweight Australian fitness industry
is worth around $2.4 billion. Having no one to train with is I think is the hardest part of staying consistent with your
fitness goals, what I have discovered that you are more likely to achieve your goals if you have like minded people with
you like Arnold had Franco on his side. If you have someone with you who is as motivated as you are you are less likely
 to miss workout, cheat on your diet etc.







<br><h2>Description</h2><br>
The major aspect of this app will be fitness and help people to achieve their fitness goals by finding people to train with across different sports and training style. To make signing up process easier user will be offered multiple quick signing up ways like sign-up via Facebook, Google Fit and Apple Id etc. In sign-up process user will be asked number of questions regarding their training style or what sport they want to engage in, then they will be asked to fill in their personal data like height, weight, diet, fitness level, hobbies and time they would like to train which later helps the software to connect with like minded people. Then they will be offered number of tools like Body mass index calculator, calorie calculator, Tailored diet plan, Exercise plans, coaching, one on one coaching and much more. After user sign-up they will be able to make their own exercise plan which they can use to track their exercise, share progress with others, they will also be able to share their exercise template with others. The app will also have feature integrated to connect with fitness devices like HR monitor, Fitness watches, Smart weighing scales and Body mass Index calculating devices, the data will automatically be uploaded into user profile and will give user feedback about their work and progress, which users will be able to share across each other on other socials which will also attract more users towards the platforms. There will be a lot of free features in this app like DIY exercise template, diet template and tools in which user can get nutrition value of foods they will be eating, the app will not be limited to training the app will promote more social fitness-oriented activities hiking, cycling, swimming, Basketball, Badminton etc. Users will also be able to access the proper exercise and training videos uploaded into exercise library created by participating trainers by buying subscriptions or coaching. With participation from local gyms subscription users will be able to meet each other and train at their preferred participating gyms or sports centers, this feature will allow users to access multiple facilities without having to sign up for them, some facilities can be included in the subscription, and some may have flat fee per visit. Users may be able to access 24/7 facilities with NFC payment like systems or with one entry-tag sort of key which can be integrated at the participating facilities. The purpose of this project will not be just making money but to provide people with enough free and paid resources that they will have absolute zero excuse to achieve their optimum health. With enough response this project can be extended to nutrition and other services like home delivered meals, exercise equipment and gear a marketplace to sell used fitness equipment and franchising possibility. This project will benefit everyone involved in fitness industry, users will have company to train with, Facilities will have more members and revenue, Fitness coaches and trainer will have more client and Information Technology will be able to fill another gap in the industry.

<br><h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>br
To be successful this project will require a lot of tools and technologies. For instance, to code website something like Microsoft VS code can be used which is integrated many useful features like Git hub commands which allows you to deploy the website from in between the software and allows you to work together with your team. Other tools like Swiftic which allows anyone to create mobile app easily it will be a great tool in the begging because you need very little knowledge to develop Mobile apps, which will be great in the beginning. This project will also require multiple servers and data management tools for that we can implement something like AWS. For any software/App to work properly it require huge amount of testing across multiple devices and that can be achieved with tool like Kobiton which provide testing on multiple real devices in the cloud. Tools and technologies like these will help to bring this project into the shape.
.


<br><h2>Skills Required</h2><br>
The basic version of this project will require knowledge HTML, CSS, Java scripts and java for the mobile app development, Database management system like MySQL. By utilizing which a website interface similar to other social network website will be created where people can meet, share their thoughts and may be arrange time to exercise together The advance version will deep knowledge of multiple programming and APIs which allow the integration of the app to devices and services discussed in the description. This project will need a team which has experts specialized in multiple fields like front-end developer, backend developers, UI-designs, data base management and cyber-security etc.
<h2>Outcome</h2><br>
If the Project is successful, it will revolutionize the fitness industry and our lives. Staying fit will be easier, it will promote healthy activities, promote healthy eating habits, encourage people to socialize more with locals instead of with someone halfway across the world. There are other fitness apps, but they function nothing like this project. This project solves the problem of trying to stay fit or healthy by providing enough support and knowledge to the user by having someone to start and continuing their journey of fitness. Finally with all the good there is considerable revenue potential to keep this project alive.
